# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that document the EDA steps performed on various datasets. The aim of this project is to analyze and understand the datasets through visualization and statistical methods, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions.

## Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data often using visual methods. This project includes a series of Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific dataset, showcasing the EDA steps taken to understand and interpret the data.

## Datasets

The following datasets are analyzed in this repository:
- Dataset 1: [Dataset Name]
- Dataset 2: [Dataset Name]
- Dataset 3: [Dataset Name]
- (Add more datasets as needed)

Each dataset is included in its respective Jupyter notebook, along with the necessary steps to load, clean, and analyze the data.

## EDA Process

The EDA process typically involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset into the notebook.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
3. **Data Exploration**: Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary statistics.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using plots and charts to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve data quality and analysis.
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Performing hypothesis testing and other statistical analyses.

Each Jupyter notebook in this repository follows these steps to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the datasets.

## Usage

To run the notebooks and perform EDA on the datasets, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies (see [Requirements](#requirements) section).
4. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5. Open the desired notebook and run the cells to perform the EDA steps.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the notebooks:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- jupyter

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
